note :  
Diversity in this context is about people with disabilities.
Cognitive & physical disabilities.

Abstract:  
TBD



Main Goal:
* We can do DDD even with a small team and too much work
* No matter how small we can have impact on the business


Type:
* Experience report talk

Challenge:
* No Slides
* do not make it a technical talk.


Things to says:

* Explain the Domain
  * as Alberto says: "Who's stupid enough to talk about his domain ?"
  * Domain was not complex, the right time to introduce some technical / design complexity (EventSourcing)
* Explain the constraints
  * small team
  * shifting priorities (in the large)
* How the team managed
  * to deal with the legacy  
  * to deal with errors & upgrade of Events stream.
  * to deal with user expectations
* How we journey went.
  * explanation should follow the different releases.
  * some things I'm not happy about in the implementation
    * but we shipped !
    * One of the most ethically rewarding project I've been on


Use the evolution of the context map with the releases

How the user put the requests on hold , so that missing info about reasonable accommodation  in airport is up to end March
