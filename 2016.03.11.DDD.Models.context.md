# Random thoughts on Models And Context

"All Models are wrong, some are useful"
This saying as an implicit concept in it.

Two examples :

A very long time ago...  
I failed miserably a chemistry lab.  
The experiment was a fractional distillation of
an [azeotropic mixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azeotrope)

We had to draw the vapor-liquid equilibrium for the mixture.
At the end of the lab, we show our curve to the lab masters...  
And they tell us , it's wrong...

Why : we forgot to document the pressure in our drawing.  
Forgetting to put the pressure completely invalidated the experiment, because the curve was valid only  given a known constant pressure.  
In other words
The model we provided  did not *document the constraints (the context) within which it is valid.*


 [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics) and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics)  
This one is easy...  
They both have mathematical models to describe the world.
The classical mechanics is useful and good enough for some cases . see [Faynman physics lectures](http://www.richard-feynman.net/videos.htm)  
Quantum physics for other.



So I propose that we make a slight change in the saying:

 "All Models are wrong, some are useful in a given context "
