# Random thoughts about DDDBE #11 meetup - Modellathon 
11 December 2014

Yesterday the [DddBe group](http://DomainDriven.be)  held it's second offcial [modellathon](http://www.meetup.com/dddbelgium/events/219005772/). 

We were about 35+ people, grouped in about 8 teams. 
And I was the Domain Expert.


## What is Modellathon? 
In short, a hackaton but for models.  
In our case, there is no modelling technique imposed.  

Each group is allowed to use whatever means they find useful. 
More detailled explanations can be found here

I've seen Event Storming, plain drawings, UI Mockups, ER diagram, text, ...  
And all those techniques actually yielded some insight into the domain.   
Explaining some part of the domain in a very straightforward fashion.  
Proof that there is no One Silver Bullet modelling technique   


## Running the modellathon
It's important to timebox the modelling sessions.  
I think 15 to 20 minutes is a good length.  

Between the modelling session,   
have the facilitators ask for feedback   
and let the group express themselve on the experience.  

* It has allowed met to rest :-) for a few minutes.  
Being the domain expert is an exhausting assignement

* It helped finding the groups that were in trouble  
, or that didn't have access to me yet.

* It is a good moment to provide some more info to the all the groups  
either about the domain , or some modelling tips from the facilitators


*Interesting twist*  
Leaving the models in place & switching teams  
You suddenly have Legacy models !

## Being the Domain Expert

If you ever want to take the role of domain expert for this kind of exercise  
make sure your are well rested, it is exhausting:  
lot's of talking and thinking about the domain.  

Take a real domain you have been working on 

Tell stories, many thanks to [Alberto Brandolini](https://twitter.com/ziobrando/) for the tip.  
Don't talk about your're own implementation

You won't know everything, be ready to accept that and say: I don't know this 

## What I gained as Domain Expert  
The domain I explained was quite broad.    
In facts, in the course of the project I'm working on ,   
what is considered as the Core Domain has changed quite a few time  
This modellathon has forced me to remember  
the different  Domains and business problems we are trying to solve.  
I was also offered the general overview of what has been built so far  

I also gained first hand experience on what is means to be a Domain Expert.  
What are the feelings real Domain Experts have when you have a bunch of  
IT minded people asking a lot of questions  
I only grasp now what it must be like to be invited, as a DA, to  
and [Event Storming](http://ziobrando.blogspot.be/2013/11/introducing-event-storming.html#.VImFN3tSI4Q) session. 

I think this kind of exercise might actually be a good way of running  
a post mortem on any project. 
In a couple of hours you get the whole picture again  
of the business goals and the project,   
and helps you realize if you've met them.
