# Random thoughts on a Domain Driven Design Epiphany

I'm having a DDD [epiphany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_%28feeling%29)

Some of the pieces, of this complex model that DDD is, are suddenly fitting together.  
Quite nicely fitting together.

I've been prototyping the model for a new piece of functionality, a completely new Bounded Context.  
And I'm in a state of flow doing this.  

Before the prototyping, we had a couple of [EventStorming]([The book](https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming) sessions that allowed to discover the true nature of the problem space.  
I made point of creating a [context map](http://www.infoq.com/articles/ddd-contextmapping)  
And this is helping so much in the actual design of the model.  
The learning from the EventStorming sessions, the context map, they are _**in**_ the design and implementation of the
model.   
The prototyping effort, is suddenly, not a prototype anymore.  
It _**is**_  the _actual_ thing, though incomplete, and some parts just left behind in the commit history.

And, side effect, I'm in the [whirpool](http://domainlanguage.com/ddd/whirlpool/)    
The learning of the problem space, the strategic aspect, the design in itself. they are feeding each other with insights.

Insights, in the domain (and that is the most important), but also in DDD itself which is a nice takeaway.


The journey, up to now, has been long, full of side roads, shortcuts (please don't do that) and dead ends.  
The journey is still very long, still lot's of thing I'm not understanding or even misunderstanding.  
But it's such a wonderful road, full of nice surprises and full of great Human Beings.
