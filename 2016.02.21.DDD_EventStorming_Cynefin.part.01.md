# Random thoughts on Domain Driven Design , EventStorming & Cynefin Part I

This is a "gut feelings thoughts" post on how those 3 approaches & practices fit together.

The gut feeling I have is that they nicely complement each other

## Disclaimer
I've learned only recently of Cynefin ,thanks to the talks of Liz Keogh (aka [@lunivore](http://lunivore.com/) )
during [Buildstuff 2015](http://buildstuff.lt/2015/) & [Domain Driven Design Europe 2016](http://dddeurope.com/2016/)

I'm only unlocking the power of Domain Driven Design strategic design.

I have a huge positive bias towards EventStorming

## What I think is Common
The three practices have in common an emphasis on managing complexity and making this effort explicit.
And this for all parties involved.

They share a set of fundamentals mantras:  
* Narratives are keys to understanding
* People must be involved
* People must share a common understanding of the problem space.  
* People should be allowed to experiment and fail safely
* The outcome of experiments are used in feedback loops.

They all have a set of practices to
* Discover the current state of the problem space
* Allow placeholders for the unknowns and unclassified  issues
* To classify problems
* To move problems around.
* To break the problems into smaller more manageable ones.
